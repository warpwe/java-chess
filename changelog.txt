This file list the major changes in between releases
====================================================

Changes for 0.1.0 alpha 1
-------------------------
This was the first release and it contained just a rough GUI to play some simple
moves. The engine was very incomplete and buggy.


Changes for 0.1.0 alpha 2
-------------------------
This changelog was started after the release of alpha 2, so I have to write this
from the top of my head.

- Added code for timers, that actually reflect who is about to move, although there's
  no event triggered when the time is over.
- Lots of bugfixes in the engine, especially in the PlyGenerator, where most of the
  plies should be computed accurately now.
- Check, checkmate and draw (not yet for triple repetition of a board) detection 
  added to the GameController, so the game is stopped then.
- Better piece set and board colors.
- About box added.
- First hashtable version with associated menu item added.
- Some initial code to save and load PGN files.

Changes for 0.1.0 alpha 3
-------------------------

- 'Thinking' and 'Player's turn' displayed depending on who is about to move.
- Started PGN header info for file save.
- Started opening book functionality.
- Reset method for entire game.
- Started permanent brain functionality.
- Improved code to save and load PGN files.
- Fixed bug in timers.
- Changed direction of the timers.
- Made minimax more responsive to timeout.
- Added default values for search time and hash size. Default search time is 5sec fix per move, hash size is 10,000 entries.
- Splitted the search time menu into two sub-menues: fix and average search time.
- Added the display of the search time and hash size to the status panel.
- Added shortcut <ALT>-<E> to reach the edit menu
- Added shortcut <S> to call the setup dialog from the edit menu
- Dialog for setup/edit position designed. Dialog call works, ToDo: implement functions
- Quiescence search added (read: the search tree is extended, if the last ply changed the
  game position significantly. This is the case, if it's a capture, a check or a pawn promotion).
  
 Changes for 0.1.1 alpha 3
 -------------------------
 
 - more Junit tests, espacially for illegal King moves and rochade problems
 - bugfixing
 - adjustments for position analyse
 - activating log feature
